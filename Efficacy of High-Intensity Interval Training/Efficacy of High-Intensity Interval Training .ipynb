    "It is recommended by the Center for Disease Control and other health organizations that individuals do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity a week, or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week (CDC). This activity can be spread evenly over 4-5 days a week. However, data collected from the CDC shows that only about 23% of all U.S. adults get the recommended amount of exercise per week. Why is this the case? Is it due to an aversion to exercise, lack of time to exercise, or a lack of opportunity? Surveys conducted by various fitness apps such as Freeletics found that “not having time” is the number one barrier to exercise that Americans face, with 42% of participants saying that time is the biggest reason they fail to work out. Thus, it would be beneficial to find an exercise routine that is time-effective and efficient in elevating heartrate, burning calories and hitting as many muscle groups in the body as possible. "

    "One largely favored solution amount physical trainers and fitness gurus alike is high-intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT workouts have grown in popularity over the past few years because of how accessible they are – HIIT exercises are incredibly effective using just bodyweight, and can be done almost anywhere. There’s no requirement for a gym, weights, or specific equipment in order to do the workout. HIIT exercises are also efficient; they are successful in elevating the heartrate and burning calories over a short period of time (Gibala 2007). However, HIIT is quite an intense workout and can be a daunting challenge for those who don’t regularly exercise. Our goal is to investigate if HIIT is truly more effective than moderate intensity training such as jogging. A comparison between HIIT and moderate intensity continuous training will be done as a reality check to see what the difference between the two training forms is. "
